## Description

This week we were tasked to create a web app that you could use to input tasks or goals and save them for different times of the day and have these time boxes change colour based if they were in the past present or future.
I wanted the time to update dynamically aswell as for the time boxes to update with out the need of the user to refresh the application.

One problem that persisted was the use of the different types of time (24/12 hour) between the day.js and the code i wrote originally.

## Usage
https://alexanderduncan1.github.io/BootcampChallenges/

Once loaded the user will be presented with the current time and date at the top of the page and 9 different boxes below.
each boxes are capable of having notes entered in by the user and then can be saved by pressing the save button on the far right of the indavidual box

If the user wishes to delete or modify the content of the time box they just need to add the desired new input and press the save button again.
