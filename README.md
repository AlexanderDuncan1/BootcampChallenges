# Code Quiz

## Your Task
In this project i atempted to make a quiz that filled the following user criteria

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

I tried to make the quiz run with as little user input as possible to create a more streamlined experiece, unfortunatly i did not get to add as much styling as i would have liked but I didnt manage to get to it.
